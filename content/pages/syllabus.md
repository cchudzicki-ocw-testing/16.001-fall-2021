## Introduction

In the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Unified Engineering, aerospace engineering is taught within the context of the CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate) framework.  Our goal is to educate future leaders in the field who can contribute to the development of new products in a modern, team-based environment.  In addition to learning the disciplinary material and acquiring the technical foundations of aerospace engineering, you will begin learning skills that will enable you to become effective aerospace engineers.

## Course Objectives

The basic objective of Unified is to give a solid understanding of the fundamental disciplines of Aerospace Engineering and to give insight into their interrelationships and applications.  In the Fall, these disciplines are Materials & Structures (16.001) and Signals & Systems (16.002).  In the Spring, the disciplines are Fluid Dynamics (16.003) and Thermodynamics (16.004).       
The second objective of Unified is to guide you toward an understanding of the fundamental skills, knowledge, and sensitivities that are the traits of a successful engineer.  These include the skills necessary to work successfully in a group (including technical and graphical communication) and those of self-education (reading, research, and experimentation).  Professional engineers have the knowledge and confidence to make estimates of poorly known parameters, create conceptual models of systems, assess the applicability of various models and their resulting solutions to encountered problems, and design new solutions to meet technical challenges. Aerospace systems in particular are very unforgiving, one can do 99.5% of the job well, but it is the error in the remaining 0.5% that may cause a major accident or failure. Aerospace engineers are known for their attention to detail and, while we do not expect perfection, we do expect that all work carried out as part of Unified Engineering be done with care and as well as possible given the time constraints of the course. 

1. Separate but Unified      
    While the disciplines have separate course numbers and will receive separate letter grades, Unified is nonetheless taught with a significant amount of unification.  This includes the structure (assignments, quizlets, exams) as well as the grading policy of the individual courses.  As such, the contents of this Course Facts apply equally to 16.001-16.004.  Also, we will have topics that are not specifically about a single discipline, but yet will be taught by one of the disciplinary faculty.  This is, in particular, true for some of the labs which often bring together more than one discipline and/or involve some aspect of design.
2. Teaching Methods      
    The Unified Engineering Team is firmly committed to helping you learn.  This commitment takes many forms, including a process of continuous improvement in our teaching effectiveness.   During this semester, the faculty will be exploiting teaching methods proven to increase students’ learning. These methods include presenting information to the student in the context of a compelling challenge or problem, stressing active versus passive learning in the classroom, enhancing feedback to the student, providing multiple opportunities for hands-on learning, etc.
3. Learning and Grades      
    Learning is a lifelong endeavor whereas learning for grades is often quite temporary (i.e. the material often is not remembered as time after an exam increases).  Further, while pursuing learning for a lifetime ability, one tends to acquire an understanding that is demonstrated in typical assessment activities, such as exams, and thereby one achieves the grades representative of the learning level desired and as expressed in the definition of grades at MIT (see below). We strongly encourage you to view all activities within Unified as opportunities for learning with the final goal of having you prepared for your career after Unified.

## Assignments, Quizlets, and Exams 

1. Problem Sets    
    Problem sets (psets) will be posted on the Canvas sites by 5:00pm on Thursdays (16.001), and Fridays (16.002).  The psets will be due at 5:00pm seven days later.  Pset problems are to be submitted in electronic form on Gradescope. The Canvas sites have direct links. Late psets will not be accepted for any reason.  As well, excused absences from a pset will not be granted.  However, we will drop the lowest graded problems that are equal to but not greater than a single pset when determining the average pset grade for the semester.  (This dropping cannot be automated on the Canvas gradebook, so your average pset grade will be slightly higher than what can be seen online.)    
    A sample homework solution is provided at the end of this document illustrating the proper way to write up a problem solution. Solutions to problem sets will be posted two hours after the pset is due.  We will endeavor to return graded problem sets within a week from when they are due. These graded psets will be available on Gradescope.
2. Quizlets    
    Each Tuesday 10-11AM after 9/14 there will be a Quizlet on the material covered in the past week. This will be a combined 50 minute exam for both 16.001 and 16.002.  The questions will cover examples, previous homework questions, and recitation questions from the past week. The first 25 minutes will cover one of the two subjects (16.001 or 16.002) and the second 25 minutes the other subject. Please note that the order of the subjects will not be the same from week to week. The quizlet problem will be drawn from (1) problems from any pset that was already due and for which the solutions have been posted, (2) problems worked in lecture or recitation, or (3) problems included in assigned reading for which solutions have been made available.  The quizlet problems will be identical to the problems from (1), (2), and (3) except possibly for some simplifications (to allow for solving the problem in the allotted quizlet time).   When taking the quizlet, you will not have any materials available to you (e.g. no “cheat sheets”).  For equations, etc. that we would not expect you to know from memory, they will be provided with the quizlet.  Depending on the quizlet, you may be able to use a calculator; please bring a calculator to the quizlet.    
    Excused absences from quizlets will not be granted. However, the lowest quizlet grade in each discipline will be dropped. This drop policy is to account for all circumstances including but not limited to: poor performance on a quizlet; missing a quizlet due to illness/oversleeping/etc; etc.    
    Note: the first Tuesday (September 14), the quizlet will be three problems drawn from the Calculus I, Calculus II, and Physics I GIR material (one problem from each subject). This quizlet will be graded. As well, for this first quizlet only, you will be allowed to submit new solutions for the quizlet and the grade on this problem will be the average of the in-class solution and the new solution. These new quizlet solutions will be due at the same time as the first set. 
3. Labs    
    Labs will often require working on a team of two or more Unified students. The details of any lab report and submission procedure will be specified for each lab.      
    Without documented extenuating circumstances, late lab reports will not be accepted and will receive zero credit. If there are extenuating circumstances and you wish to request an extension (whether planned due to a conflict known well in advance, or due to an unforeseen circumstance), please contact the instructors directly, preferably by email, as soon as possible.
4. Exams    
    There will be an in-class  2-hour Midterm for each of 16.001 (10/28) and 16.002 (11/5) and a final exam for each course (date TBD).
