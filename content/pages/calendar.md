M1: Describe a structure, its functions, and associated objectives and tradeoffs.   
M2: Describe the basic mechanical properties of aerospace materials. Describe the general classes of materials used in aerospace and their specific applications.   
M3: Define the “Three Great Principles” of solid mechanics: Equilibrium, compatibility and constitutive response.   
M4: Determine the relation between applied and transmitted forces and moments, for a par- ticle, set of particles, and rigid body in equilibrium. Apply the concept of equipollent force/moment to model and simplify the analysis of force systems.   
M5: Represent and use idealizations of structural supports. Draw Free Body Diagrams for structural systems. Classify mechanical systems according to their state of equilibrium: underdetermined, determinate, indeterminate. Calculate reactions in determinate   
M6: Analyze truss structures using the method of joints and the method of sections.   
M7: Define the constitutive relationship for elastic bars. Apply compatibility of deformation in a variety of structural configurations. Analyze statically indeterminate bar and truss systems using the “Three Great Principles”.   
M8: Define the concept of stress at a material point and its mathematical representation as a second-order tensor. Describe the state of stress at a point using cartesian tensorial components, and their meaning as a measure of the local measure of loading at material points in structural systems. Explain stress equilibrium in differential form.   
M9: Explain the basis for transforming stress states between two different cartesian bases.   
Transform two-dimensional stress states, compute principal stresses and directions.   
M10: Define the concept of strain at a material point as the fundamental measure of the local state of deformation and its relation to the displacement field. Describe strain as a second-order tensor, its cartesian components and their meaning.   
M11: Explain the basis for transforming strain states between two different cartesian bases.   
Transform two-dimensional strain states, compute principal strains and directions.   
M12: Describe the constitutive relationship between stress and strain for isotropic and or- thotropic linear elastic materials.   
M13: Discuss engineering/elastic constants, their measurement, and their relationship to the tensorial description of Hooke’s law.

M14: Summarize the key equations of the the theory of elasticity. Formulate and simplify problems in general elasticity, apply displacement and traction boundary conditions to problems in elasticity and solve simple cases.   
M15: Analyze the structural response of uniaxially-loaded slender elements: Rods and bars M16) Analyze the structural response of transversely-loaded slender elements: Beams. In-   
ternal forces and beam deflections.   
M17: Analyze the stability of slender structural elements subject to compressive loads: buck- ling loads, mode shapes, effects of imperfections and eccentric loads.
