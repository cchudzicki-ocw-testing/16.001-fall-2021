Good engineers use accepted standards in reporting work.  In regard to submitted work in Unified, the following is accepted practice:

- Each problem should be stapled individually when you turn in your pset.  So, if there are five problems in a pset, you will turn in five separate, stapled problems. 
- Write your name on all sheets you turn in.
- Number the sheets for each problem in sequential order indicating the sequence of each sheet in that answer.
- Clearly indicate with whom you worked on every question you submit.
- You do not need to type up your solutions but must write legibly.
- State your assumptions, and display graphs and equations neatly.
- Explain your solution clearly and interpret your results.
- Clearly identify intermediate results and their importance.
- Units must be explicitly described and identified in all work and solutions.
- Clearly identify (e.g. underline, box, etc) your final answer for any part of a problem.

Communication is a key part of the ability of an engineer.  Demonstrating your ability to communicate is part of demonstrating your learning level. The sample that follows is meant to illustrate the proper way to write up a problem solution.  You will see the concepts relevant to this problem in the lecture.
